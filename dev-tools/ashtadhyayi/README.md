# README

The script `generate-prakriyas.ts` is used to generate the necessary prakriyas for all the words for the inscriptions on the site. It can be run seamlessly through the command `pnpm run generate-prakriyas`.

The `assets` folder contains external dependencies that are needed to generate the prakriyas.
